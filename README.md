# ErrCatch
The priceComp.py code compares two lines in a given log file with the same strike values that were created within a certain time of each other.
The code checks to see if the buy or sell prices are different for different energy options.
If they are different, then the program returns the two lines, meaning there is an error.
The .idea file contains PyCharm files for the project.
The tester.txt file contains a tester file that tests to see if the program can catch errors.

The status.py code is given a log file and 2 arguments. The program then searches through the file at a certain time for a certain tool.
It then finds out if algorithms are enabled for each symbol associated with the tool, and all of the terms for that symbol
