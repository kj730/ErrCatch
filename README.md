# ErrCatch
The priceComp.py code compares two lines in a given log file with the same strike values that were created within a certain time of each other.
The code checks to see if the buy or sell prices are different for different energy options.
If they are different, then the program returns the two lines, meaning there is an error
The .idea file contains PyCharm files for the project
The tester.txt file contains a tester file that tests to see if the program can catch errors
